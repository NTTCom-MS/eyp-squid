## Overview

A one-maybe-two sentence summary of what the module does/what problem it solves.
This is your 30 second elevator pitch for your module. Consider including
OS/Puppet version it works with.

## Module Description

If applicable, this section should have a brief description of the technology
the module integrates with and what that integration enables. This section
should answer the questions: "What does this module *do*?" and "Why would I use
it?"

If your module has a range of functionality (installation, configuration,
management, etc.) this is the time to mention it.

## Setup

### What squid affects

* A list of files, packages, services, or operations that the module will alter,
  impact, or execute on the system it's installed on.
* This is a great place to stick any warnings.
* Can be in list or paragraph form.

### Setup Requirements

This module requires pluginsync enabled

### Beginning with squid

```puppet
class { 'squid':
		visible_hostname => 'example',
		disable_cache => true,
	}
```

## Usage

accesslog/logformat:

```puppet
squid::logformat { 'squid-demo':
  format => 'timestamp="%{%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z}tg" vendor="Squid" src=%>a url="%>ru" src_ip=%">a status=%<Hs http_user_agent="%{User-Agent}>h" http_method=%>rm http_content_type=%mt http_content_type_raw="%{Content-Type}<h" bytes_in=%<st bytes_out=%>st user=%un http_referer="%{Referer}>h" uri_path="%rp" url_port=%<p uri_scheme=%>rs duration=%<tt dest_port=%<p src_port=%>p dest_ip=%<a proxy_ip=%<la proxy_dest_port=%>lp proxy_src_port=%<lp dest_host=%{Host}>h',
}

squid::accesslog { '/var/log/squid/access.log':
  logformat => 'squid-demo',
}
```

## Reference

Here, list the classes, types, providers, facts, etc contained in your module.
This section should include all of the under-the-hood workings of your module so
people know what the module is touching on their system but don't need to mess
with things. (We are working on automating this section!)

## Limitations

This is where you list OS compatibility, version compatibility, etc.

## Development

We are pushing to have acceptance testing in place, so any new feature should
have some test to check both presence and absence of any feature

### TODO

* upstream proxy: http://www.christianschenk.org/blog/using-a-parent-proxy-with-squid/
